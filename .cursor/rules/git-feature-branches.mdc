# Git Feature Branch Workflow

Before making feature changes or fixes:

1. **Create a feature branch** from main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   git checkout -b feature/short-descriptive-name
   ```

2. **Work on the branch** – make all edits and commits on the feature branch.

3. **Push the branch** when ready:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/short-descriptive-name
   ```

4. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub from the feature branch into main.

5. **Do not commit or push directly to main.** Use PRs for merging.

Branch naming: `feature/thing-name` or `fix/thing-name`.
